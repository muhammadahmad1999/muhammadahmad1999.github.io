## Introduction

The beautiful and _unique_ light that children bring into this world is contagious:
their unique laughter, questions, perspectives, and amusements. Their questions
might seem silly at first, yet many a times cause us to pause and think; their
insatiable interest in “mundane” things reminds us of the **inquisitiveness we once
had as children**. It is not a coincidence that many cultures, if not all, have their
equivalent for the phrase:
“Children are full of life!”

It is with a heart full of agony that this document had to be written: there should **never
have been a need to write this document.** One cannot help but relate with this
tragedy: we all, one way or another, have witnessed this light in our families, friends’
families, or around the world. We all have, one way or another, been affected by their
contagious happiness, so it is only fair that we be equally affected by their **loss**.

The name of this Innocent Child was Fatima. Fatima is a name of Arabic origin,
meaning **Captivating** or **Shining One**. Fatima’s name evokes the memory of a
captivating and beautiful flower, similar to the one attached to the front of this document.
Just like this flower and her name, she must have been a captivating and shining
human being; she must have been the **light** in the world for her **family**.

Crimes against children resonate with us on a deeper level is due to the inherent
powerlessness of the victim against the perpetrator: it is the extreme sorrow one feels
at the **loss** of the potential life, achievements, happiness that this Innocent Child and
those they left behind **might** have seen. Children are akin to a “blank canvas” and it
is not easy for **most** human hearts to “ **pigeonhole** ” their tragedy due to our prejudices
or biases.

They **force** us to have a deep introspection of the world around us and lead to tough
questions that require tough answers. This deep introspection provides a **_rare_**
**opportunity to undo the very conditions that allowed these crimes to be
committed,** preventing unimaginable future agony.

Out of respect to Fatima, her family and human decency, this _introduction_ does not
delve into the graphic details of the crimes committed against her. Accounts of the
crimes against her have been narrated, **_regrettably_** , in the appendix of this document:
the severity of the crime and the reports of a real risk to numerous more Fatimas (see
appendix) made repeating this unspeakable atrocity a necessity.

Why is there a need for this document? With her voice tragically silenced, it falls upon
us to raise her voice. However, the path to justice is marred by the consistent betrayals
of those in power. They not only fail in their primary duty of protection but also indulge
in hollow expressions of sympathy. How can their promises of 'support for Human
Rights' and assurances of 'bringing the culprits to justice' be trusted?

Then is the **"waiting game"**. This isn't the prolonged wait for justice that victims often
endure in most of the world: here it's seems almost to be a **“calculated pause** ”,
waiting for public memory to fade. Once an issue slips from the public's immediate
consciousness, it's easier for the course of Justice to be subverted.

In this new **dark night** , it is incumbent upon all with hearts that bleed and are not
made of stones, to keep lighting “vigils” throughout the world, in whatever way they
can.

>**Sure**, these <u>“small”</u> vigils might not ever be able to illuminate the entire world with
there **demand for Justice**;<br/><br/>
> **Sure**, these <u>“small”</u> vigils might not ever be able to illuminate the entire world with
there **demand for Justice**;<br/><br/>
> **Sure**, these “small” vigils might be the literal manifestation of **“The Road Not Taken”**.<br/><br/>
> **Indeed**, most of those lighting these vigils might not have the capacity nor the
socio-economic capability to figuratively **“make the night seem like the day”**;<br/><br/>
>**Certainly**, the fear of **personal safety** will visit the minds of those who attend these
**“vigils”**.



Yet, is this fear greater than the one Fatima must have gone through? Ours might only,
and God Willing will only, be a figment of our imagination. Imagine for a brief moment,
the fear and brutality that Fatima must have faced near the end of her short life?
What the beating heart of a decent human cannot even bear to imagine is nothing
compared to the real agony that Fatima felt!


Many who have hearts of stone will fail to comprehend this; many who turn their
otherwise beating hearts to stone, selectively, will try to shrug this injustice “under the
rug”. Such heinous crimes will make even the most optimistic person’s faith in Humanity
as a whole rattle if not shatter.


Yet I have seen the beauty of what Good humans with a beating heart can accomplish.
I have seen the miracles that Loving humans can accomplish when they band together.
My ears have heard the beautiful symphonies that Humans with a heart of Gold can
forge onto the very fabric of reality! Every people have their history filled with accounts
of what these Forces of Good were able to accomplish against all odds.


The previous Forces of Good faced rejection. They felt dejected when confronted with
insurmountable odds. Often disorganised and with limited means, their minds teemed
with doubts about ever achieving Justice. The fear of vengeful retribution by tyrants
weighed heavily on their minds.


I propose a very simple dilemma to express but a very tough dilemma to overcome
in reality: if the above odds did not stop these previous Forces of Good from etching
the symphony of their struggle upon the very fabric of human history , is there
any reason for us not to even attempt to follow in their footsteps?


We might not meet the same success they did, yet if we do embark on this arduous
journey to demand justice for an Innocent Soul we will surely find ourselves being
resembled to these Forces of Good in the past. Let us light vigils in whatever small
ways we can so that the light that was Fatima is not allowed to be extinguished and
her tyrants are brought to swift justice!


Otherwise, who else is there to stop Fatima from being forgotten and turned into a
mere statistics, if even the Forces of Good do not clamour and demand justice for
her? An endless circle of injustice needs to be stopped somewhere: if her tyrant is
made an example of, can any sane mind argue that future tyrants would still be as
likely to commit these heinous acts?


I will end with a beautiful verse from the Holy Quran on this topic (21:112). It was a
prayer that the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon
him), who was also an Orphan, is said to have recited when he faced a struggle:

___
<div style="background-color: rgba(236,140,140,0.51); border-radius: 1em"><br/><p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25em"><b>Content Warning</b></p><p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.05em; padding: 1.5em;">The following section contains distressing textual details about the crime. Reader discretion is advised.</p></div>
<br/>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25em"><b>Appendix</b></p>

<div style="background-color: rgba(236,191,140,0.51); padding: 1.5em; border-radius: 1em">
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25em"><u>Disclaimer</u></p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.05em">
Due to the gruesome nature of the crime and out of respect to Fatima and her family,
it does not behove decency to repeat the intricate graphic image/video evidence of
the heinous crimes committed by the perpetrator. As such, the decision was taken to
not include any source with graphic imagery (namely the CCTV footage) that has made
it into the public domain.

Unfortunately, in order to convey the true gravity of the crime committed and due to
the reported persistent threat to numerous more Fatimas, regrettably, graphic text
details of this crime had to be included.

A very thin fine line needs to be respected in this incident between the need to repeat
the unspeakable horrors that Fatima and others have faced yet at the same time it is
crucial to respect that Fatima was a real innocent daughter of a real human family. If
the hearts of total strangers are filled with agony, the depths of agony of those that the
victim has left behind cannot even be fathomed by anyone else.

Hence, I apologise unreservedly, if at any point I have erred on the wrong side of this
line: it does not take a huge leap of imagination to understand how the repetition of
these incidents can haunt those that Fatima has left behind.
