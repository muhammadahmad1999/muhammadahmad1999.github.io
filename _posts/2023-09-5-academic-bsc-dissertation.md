> Reinforcement Learning for Self-Driving Cars

In my third year studying Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at the University of Leeds, I got the opportunity to research Reinforcement Learning (RL) in depth. The title of my project was "Reinforcement Learning for Self-Driving Cars". I received a grade of 80% on this project.

The Individual Project had a thesis (the report is attached to this post) and a practical demonstration of the ideas in the report — the project aimed to determine how suitable Reinforcement Learning is in this problem domain. Unlike Supervised Learning approaches, the Reinforcement Learning Agent was given very sparse feedback: the agent was not given a training set, for example, a set of images with the ideal steering angle. Instead, the agent was provided very sparse feedback through a score based on its performance in an episode.

The Reinforcement Learning approach is much more similar to how humans and other Biological Agents learn, i.e., through trial and error along with feedback from the environment. The promise of Reinforcement Learning is due to the premise that the agent will be able to learn or discover novel solutions to problems, which humans have not discovered due to other limitations.

Overall, the project was very successful, with the RL agent performing successfully in 97% of episodes in evaluation. Latex was used to write the report, which allowed the automatic generation of Lists of figures, Table of Contents, Index etc. The final report had 54 pages and 13615 words in total.

Overall Comments on the project from the supervisor and assessor:
"A strong project overall, with much to commend. Detailed and thorough research in an interesting and industry-relevant topic. Sufficiently challenging in terms of technical requirements, Ahmad has also managed to tell a useful story in this report that clearly maps and details the projects’ progress and findings. Very strong detailed results, demonstrating in-depth engagement with the research topic. The report structure could have been stronger, with most content grouped in the Results section (that would have been better suited in other sections), but the required content is here. Good to see an engagement and awareness, thinking around some of the broader issues in contemporary AI usage, plus the practical demonstrations of his work in progress showed a solid understanding of the tasks requirements throughout. Well done!"
