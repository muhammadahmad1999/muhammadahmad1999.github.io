> Classifying German Dialects Using Only Text

### Introduction
The data mining community has created numerous resources for English linguistic analysis, for example, The Brown Corpus (Francis & Kucera, 1967) and the ICE International Corpus of English. It has been shown that, in general, the larger the size of the training corpus for a classifier model, the better the classifierâ€™s performance (Banko & Brill, 2001).

With this in mind, corpora for other languages with several national dialects could benefit from further attention. This paper describes the collection, preparation and text classification tasks we have performed on four national dialects of the **German** language: **Deutsch**, **Austrian**, **Swiss**, **Liechtensteinisch**.
