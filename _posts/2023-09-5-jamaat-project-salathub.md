> SalatHub â€“ Interactive Educational App to Teach Salat (Namaz)

### Project Description
I developed an interactive learning mobile app (educational) using ***React Native*** for the **Ahmadiyya Muslim Association** called SalatHub ([https://salathub.co.uk/](https://salathub.co.uk/)). The app utilises different types of interactive quizzes and gamification (badges) as the primary mode of learning. Multimedia content is used to further aid the learning process (video and audio).

I was the sole developer on this project and had to work on a very tight deadline, along with managing my time for my exams and coursework at University. I lead the project from the design stage all the way to deployment and product listing on the iOS and Play Store. Along the way, I had the opportunity to work very closely with an experienced UX and UI designer.

The app's design was provided on Figma and had to be translated and modified to look good on both the Apple App Store (iOS) and Android Play Store. Being the sole developer on this project meant I had to interact with various stakeholders, deciding what development features needed to be prioritised for a successful product release (due to a tight deadline) and what could be left for a future release.

I ensured that intensive testing, both technical and user based, was carried out before launch, which allowed problems with the app to be removed before launch. The entire application was tested by many individuals on Android and iOS phones, along with qualitative user use case studies.

An agile development methodology was used, where the different members of the team regularly carried out iterative testing of the application, which allowed for early detection and removal of problems with the app.

This promo video ([Instagram link to original launch promo video](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CicrBU2qZaP/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D)) was used as part of the successful marketing campaign and shows the many features SalatHub provides.

Overall, the project was very successful and was launched by the international Head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community at a national convention. The app has an international audience and has been highly rated on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store ([www.salathub.co.uk](www.salathub.co.uk) provides links for the app on both of these stores).
