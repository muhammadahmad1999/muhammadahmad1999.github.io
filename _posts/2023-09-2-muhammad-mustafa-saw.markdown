### Introduction
The recent tragic human rights violations around the world have rightly caused ripples around the World. From Churches burning in India's Manipur to Churches burning in Pakistan. From Temples burning in Jerusalam to Temples burning in African countries.

The tragic cases involving innocent children all over the world, in which even Innocent Children were not spared has rightly caused a stir around the world.

However, the question that comes to mind is why is it that a tragedy of a Child touches the hearts of most souls while other tragedies can be easily **'pigeonholed'**?

In my opinion, it is the fact that **all** humans can one way or another relate with a Child. They might have seen a child (family and friends etc). However, even if they have not, were we all not *once* children? Do we not remember fondly our tales from childhood, a **clarity** in vision, a **natural** inquisitiveness, an **undying** thirst to learn (even though at times we might *have* preferred a movie over reading a book. ðŸ˜ƒ)

Do we all not find these tales from childhood rightly inspiring? I do.

The question though is ***why***?

___

>The reason, at least to me, from recent interactions on X (formerly Twitter), seems to be that a Child has the three crucial qualities listed above:
>1. Clarity in **vision**.
>2. Genuine **inquisitiveness** (being amazed by what might seem simple *or* mundane to us *'more mature'* adults).
>3. Undying thirst for **knowledge**.

It's almost as if there are no *'veils'* between a child and their *soul* / *purpose* in life.

This might seem confusing at first but that is the whole point: a child **knows** what **they** truly value. This is evident from **ironically** one of their qualities that most people *complain* about: children leave things very quickly, cannot 'focus' on things etc.

Why is this the case? (It is often when comparing/contrasting two concepts that one gets the '*gist*/essence' of a concept. Think about it: why do we feel a car or horse accelerating/decelerating initially **but not** when driving on 120 km/h for a while on a *straight* road?)

In fact, **this whole** article up to this point has been an *exercise* in this whole concept. [1]

Could it be that this **juxtaposition** i.e. comparing and contrasting is what leads to *true* insights?

Isn't it peculiar that Enlightened Sages and Holy Books from the past, wise people, a good investor all *mostly* talk in **parables**, not in black and white? Isn't the Quran covered with countless commands to "pause and think"?

However, when it comes to their **real fundamental** ideals they are uncompromisingly loyal.

>Allama Iqbal (Poet of the East) summarises this idea beautifully in his **Bal-e-Jibril: 139 - Aik Naujawan Ke Naam - To A Young Man** [3]

Equally, isn't this explained beautifully by the song Khalasi from Coke Studio Baharat (India)? [4]

I mean the very reason you are still reading this article *probably* is because it is different from the majority of the articles out there.

There are so many parables for this: "Where everyone thinks the same, no one thinks a lot" etc. No investment advisor, *ideally*, would ever just tell you to "invest and don't think".

Isn't it peculiar most of the Enlightened Sages from the past faced immense adversity? The Holy Prophet Muhammad Mustafa (saw) was an Orphan after all. How many movies will we need to *see* to finally understand the plight of an Orphan (trick question)?

This is tragically evident from the saying of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (saw) in his hadith (find reference):
(on the lines of): "If only I could here the call of my mother I would stop my namaz."

___

Reading intricate detailed imaginative language about **day** and **night** in a book for years will still *not* give the same experience as seeing **day** and **night**.

Could this actually be linked to what we call **entropy**, the "most misunderstood concept in Physics" as beautifully explained by
Veritasium? [2] 

Could it be that the only way to maintain something of value in this universe is by devoting a whole amount of **high-quality** energy to it (see video from Veritasium for more context)? That is what the sun provides, according to the video above: a constant source of **concentrated high-quality energy**.

Energy cannot be destroyed, so when we look at the amount of energy that the earth radiates back, it should more or less be the same as the energy it got in (irradiance?), although I am not sure if this would be the case if there are climate change issues/imbalances.

In religious terminology this "concentrated high-quality energy" is called "light" (metaphorically) or "noor" (in Islam). This "energy" is said to come from a higher power. So it seems the only real way to learn/develop a skill/build a house will be to spend high quality energy (persistence and skill) to this task. This is also exactly what mindfulness/intentional living theories state.

___

>So the question now is, who do we owe loyalty to? This is a very tough, personal and subjective (based on different contexts) question. A very simplistic answer would be that we owe loyalty to:
>1. Those who spent a huge amount of this "high quality energy"/"noor" on us to make us what we are today
>2. To all those who share our **true** values that our *heart of hearts* knows. 

Note the deliberate use of **unbiased** language above: depending on the different scenarios. *"Good"/"Evil"* or *"Us"/"Them"*, that excludes large parts of society, is too rough and extreme decision boundary to classify the diversity in humanity and thought that is present.

Examples, however, can be given with which most humans should hopefully agree:
1. Under this, first and foremost, would be your parents because I am not sure about you but I gave mine quite a lot of trouble and headache. Your teachers and your mentors would be in this category. Anyone who showed you kindness would be in this category etc.
2. If, for example, you actually support human rights **objectively** for all not for a select few, you would raise your voice for any injustice anywhere committed by anyone.

The recent tragic cases of the innocent children killed by Lucy Letby in Britain, Fatima Fairo, Rizwana, and Seema in Pakistan had caused inexpressible anxiety to many people around the world. The sad reality of the fact that these young children will never get to realise their potential nor will we be able to witness this is truly heartbreaking.

Many people would have found going out at sunrise and sunset for walks quite helpful in this scenario. Why is it that this seems to help? Why is it that major religions advise to "meditate"/"pray" before sunrise or after sunset etc.?

I have not researched into this but my gut feeling is that it is the **sudden** change from night to day (sunrise) and day to night (sunset) that attracts us humans to these times. Just like Veratasium show near the end of their video with the example of coloured liquids flowing into each other, it is these very moments of change in fortunes/change in states that are truly worth watch. [2]

And to get this point across, here is a simulation (procedurally generated) to give a visual example of this:
