### Course Description

In this course ([link with referral code](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-graphical-operating-system-from-scratch/?referralCode=999565841E146B214A15)), we will start from a blank file and end up with a toy Graphical operating system. The emphasis is on the word toy.

Our operating system is nowhere a competitor for windows, however, it is good enough for a proof of concept.
