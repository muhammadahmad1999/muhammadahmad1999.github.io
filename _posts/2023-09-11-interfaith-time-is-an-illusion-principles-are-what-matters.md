### Introduction

Based on interactions online on X (formerly Twitter), it seems there is a big misconception that each one of us (academics, experts, “common” man or woman, cricket team supporters, investors etc.) has: we don't understand **_time_**.

And this is no surprise: look at the amount of self-help books, courses, leadership seminars on how to use **_time_** effectively. There is a reason for this:

> ## Time **<u>indeed</u>** is the **<u>rarest</u>** of commodities, if one **<u>thinks</u>** deeply enough.

And you are not alone: even seasoned Physicists, like we will see below, will tell you that we do not understand time at all, on a **deeper** level, even after centuries of **combined** _human_ effort.

### What is Time?

Now this title might seem like the title of a _sci-fi movie_ but if you think about it, are the times we are going through not worth 100's of sci-fi movies? Why? Look at this image below:

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/dubai/dubai-1990.png" alt="Simple Summary of High Level Islamic Terminology" style="width: 20em"/></p>

If you were to look at this photo, and did not look at what the reference of the image says, and you were to put the likelihood of this city succeeding one day, what probability would you assign? Remember **_just_** **by looking at the image** - no **_other_** source of information.

If you are anything like me, you would say, there seems to be **huge** potential here but I just cannot see the people of the city overcoming the hurdles to turn this around? If you are not a “glass half-full” kind of person, you might even say that “there is **no** chance that this city can ever succeed”, nay you might even say “this city will not _survive_ (God forbid) for very long”.

Yet look at this image below of this same city in **_2007_**:

The people of this **nation** proved all the naysayers wrong by their wisdom and determination. This city, if you have not connected the dots yet, is probably one of the most **famous** Metropolis in the world: **Dubai**.

Now note the unusual name for a large city that I have used: **_Metropolis_**. There is an important reason for this:

> In the 1920s after the **Great War (World War 1)**, there were the roaring 1920s. In this time period there was a huge amount of material progress due to the industry shifting from a war orientation to a civilian orientation. At this time, however, there were **free** thinkers who were **rightly** worried about the **pace** of technological advancement and the importance to not **halt** this advance but to advance more **cautiously**. This sentiment is beautifully captured by the silent-film [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis)

So who was right? The naysayers who only saw **doom,** or the "uber-optimists" who only saw **rivers** of _milk_ and _honey_? 

> Like **_most_** things in life, the truth lies in the detail, or the “greys” between the black of **doom** and the white of **unconstrained success**. It is only when you mix the two, do you see the beautiful and intricate patterns emerge that can help us understand the future direction of the world (courtesy of **Veritasium** [https://youtu.be/DxL2HoqLbyA?si=9YbLRqZD4rS-S2sX](https://youtu.be/DxL2HoqLbyA?si=9YbLRqZD4rS-S2sX)).

In fact, time is one of the things that stumps Physicists: most of the Laws of the Universe are **symmetrical** in the sense that they work the same backward and forward. Think of a car and all the Laws of Physics (aka the Laws of the Universe) that are employed to make that marvel of engineering work. All these “Laws” work the same if you are driving forward or backward, left or right aka **_symmetrical_**.

Time is different: we have always seen a **cube melt** but never seen a **cube "un-melt"**? (I think this is from the **Veritasium** video above as well). So time seems to be what will be the so called “final frontier” in Science in my humble opinion (time travel backwards in time that is) but I am not a Physicist so am likely to be way off the mark here.

However, ignoring the **reality** of time, one thing that should make sense now is that **_Principles_** are universal: if fire and ice exist on Earth, we know they will exist on any other planet in the universe like the Earth or like Mars etc.

> We don't have to travel to this distant planet to figure out for sure that Fire and Ice does exist on this planet to make an **educated** guess (which is very likely to be true) that it does exist on the said planet.

What is the full/final metric of proof? Sending a spacecraft to the said planet and livestreaming the fire and ice or even better sending a human there and asking him/her questions about the Fire and Ice they say/recorded on this planet.
