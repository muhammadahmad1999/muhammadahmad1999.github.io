### Introduction

Based on interactions online on X (formerly Twitter), it seems there is a big misconception that each one of us (academics, experts, “common” man or woman, cricket team supporters, investors etc.) has: we don't understand **_time_**.

And this is no surprise: look at the amount of self-help books, courses, leadership seminars on how to use **_time_** effectively. There is a reason for this:

> ## Time **<u>indeed</u>** is the **<u>rarest</u>** of commodities, if one **<u>thinks</u>** deeply enough.

And you are not alone: even seasoned Physicists, like we will see below, will tell you that we do not understand time at all, on a **deeper** level, even after centuries of **combined** _human_ effort.

### What is Time?

Now this title might seem like the title of a _sci-fi movie_ but if you think about it, are the times we are going through not worth 100's of sci-fi movies? Why? Look at this image below:

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/dubai/dubai-1990.png" alt="Simple Summary of High Level Islamic Terminology" style="width: 20em"/></p>

If you were to look at this photo, and did not look at what the reference of the image says, and you were to put the likelihood of this city succeeding one day, what probability would you assign? Remember **_just_** **by looking at the image** - no **_other_** source of information.

If you are anything like me, you would say, there seems to be **huge** potential here but I just cannot see the people of the city overcoming the hurdles to turn this around? If you are not a “glass half-full” kind of person, you might even say that “there is **no** chance that this city can ever succeed”, nay you might even say “this city will not _survive_ (God forbid) for very long”.

Yet look at this image below of this same city in **_2007_**:

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/dubai/Sheikh_Zayed_Road_on_28_December_2007.webp" alt="Simple Summary of High Level Islamic Terminology" style="width: 20em"/></p>

The people of this **nation** proved all the naysayers wrong by their wisdom and determination. This city, if you have not connected the dots yet, is probably one of the most **famous** Metropolis in the world: **Dubai**.

Now note the unusual name for a large city that I have used: **_Metropolis_**. There is an important reason for this:

> In the 1920s after the **Great War (World War 1)**, there were the roaring 1920s. In this time period there was a huge amount of material progress due to the industry shifting from a war orientation to a civilian orientation. At this time, however, there were **free** thinkers who were **rightly** worried about the **pace** of technological advancement and the importance to not **halt** this advance but to advance more **cautiously**. This sentiment is beautifully captured by the silent-film [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis)

___

So who was right? The naysayers who only saw **doom,** or the "uber-optimists" who only saw **rivers** of _milk_ and _honey_? 

> Like **_most_** things in life, the truth lies in the detail, or the “greys” between the black of **doom** and the white of **unconstrained success**. It is only when you mix the two, do you see the beautiful and intricate patterns emerge that can help us understand the future direction of the world (courtesy of **Veritasium** [https://youtu.be/DxL2HoqLbyA?si=9YbLRqZD4rS-S2sX](https://youtu.be/DxL2HoqLbyA?si=9YbLRqZD4rS-S2sX)).

In fact, time is one of the things that stumps Physicists: most of the Laws of the Universe are **symmetrical** in the sense that they work the same backward and forward. Think of a car and all the Laws of Physics (aka the Laws of the Universe) that are employed to make that marvel of engineering work. All these “Laws” work the same if you are driving forward or backward, left or right aka **_symmetrical_**.

Time is different: we have always seen a **cube melt** but never seen a **cube "un-melt"**? (I think this is from the **Veritasium** video above as well). So time seems to be what will be the so called “final frontier” in Science in my humble opinion (time travel backwards in time that is) but I am not a Physicist so am likely to be way off the mark here.

However, ignoring the **reality** of time, one thing that should make sense now is that **_Principles_** are universal: if fire and ice exist on Earth, we know they will exist on any other planet in the universe like the Earth or like Mars etc.

> We don't have to travel to this distant planet to figure out for sure that Fire and Ice does exist on this planet to make an **educated** guess (which is very likely to be true) that it does exist on the said planet.

What is the full/final metric of **proof**? Sending a spacecraft to the said planet and livestreaming the fire and ice or even better sending a human there and asking him/her questions about the Fire and Ice they say/recorded on this planet.

Now in order to show that **time** does indeed seem to be an illusion, I will take a very **unusual** route: I will analyse inspirational songs from different periods written in very different contexts and by very different people: I will show that because the writers were **brethren** in their school of thought, their writings even in different languages are saying the same things.

As such, the following songs/poems/nazms will be analysed:
1. [JERMAINE EDWARDS- Beautiful Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lQedCA1zJY&list=RD1lQedCA1zJY&start_radio=1)
2. [El pueblo unido, jamás será vencido [+English Translation]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH1B-Th813Q)
3. [Coke Studio Bharat - Geejaga Hakki - Sanjith Hegde x Charan Raj
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj6FfNmzCHY)
4. [Humood - Kun Anta (Lyrics)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yr-9hdROsU)
5. [Coke Studio Bharat - Khalasi - Aditya Gadhvi x Achint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7wSjy9Lv-o)
6. [Baang-e-Dara: 31 - Mouj-e-Darya - موجِ دریا - Allama Iqbal - Iqbaliyat - AadhiBaat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeozwqgDPGw&t=65s)

### Beautiful Day
There is a reason I chose the image of the beautiful **sunrise** at the start of this article. Life can indeed be quite tiring, especially when one is fighting for the Weak and their rights (Universal Human Rights). Yet, it is these small yet amazing moments, such as a sunrise and sunset, that make life worth living: the rest of the day seems pretty dull _usually_ **to me personally** and I love the dynamic colours, vibrant patterns that emerge at times **of great change** (such as from Night to Day or Day to Night).

In honour of our Jamaican (apologies for the **mistake**) brethren, I will first start this **unusual** analysis of Science and Songs to explain a scientific principle with the song **Beautiful Day** by **Jermaine Edwards**.

The song was released on the YouTube channel 9 years ago in 2014, yet because **it talks about principles** it will still have the same impact on someone a 1000 years from now if **that someone** can understand this song.

> I don't wanna act too **high** and **mighty** <br/>
> Cause tomorrow I might **fall** down on **ma face**

The writer starts by reminding **man** of his *finite* **life** and **circumstances**: humility is a very beautiful characteristic of humans, as it makes us **aware** of our mistakes in the **Past** and creates a strong desire for **change**, both **within** and **outside** ourselves. 

> Lord I **thank** you for **sunshine** <br/>
> Thank you for **rain** <br/>

In Spiritual Terminology, sunshine is associated with success, so the writer is reminding man that _any_ **success** he has requires **thanks** the the True Lord (Allah - the God), as man can accomplish nothing on his own.

The next verse is a beautiful juxtaposition: "Thank you for **rain**": rain can either be a source of blessings (after a drought) or can be a source of a severe trial (can cause flooding etc.) As such, the author is reminding us that even though **rain** looks very nice to watch, just like the Holy Prophet Muhammad Mustafa (saw/pbuh) used to get anxious when seeing rain clouds, one must always remember Allah (the God) in such times. Allah (the God) is the source of **all that is _Good_**: anything that comes from **Him**, even trials, are **Good**.

> Thank you for **joy** <br/>
> Thank you for **pain**

 In the next two verses, the author reiterates these concepts more **explicitly** by juxtaposing thanks for **joy** (sunshine/sunny day) and **pain** (which rain can cause sometimes - flooding, cold etc.).

> It's a **beautiful Day** Ey Ey Ey ey <br/>
> It's a **beautiful Day** Ey Ey ey

After this the author reminds us, that it is this alternation between **Day** and **Night**, **Night** and **Day**, **Joy** and **Pain**, **Pain** and **Joy** that makes life fascinating and unique: this is the **“twinkle”** of life just like there is a **“twinkle”** in the **Stars** (**"jag mag"** - Punjabi).

The rest of the song alternates on similar themes, hence, I have decided to not analyse it for fear of redundancy.

___

Note now how similar the above song (and I believe the author is of a **Christian** background) is to the Teachings of the Holy Quran, Sunnah and Ahadith? The author of this song is of a different time period, religion and culture than our Lord and Master **Hadhrat Muhammad Mustafa (saw/pbuh)**, yet because what he is saying agrees with the **principles** of what the **Seal of the Prophets** (saw/pbuh) said, we can say that what the author says has Wisdom **even though the author's name is not mentioned in the _Quran_**.

> So if we can apply this **principle** in the **Future**, why can we not do the same for the **Past** (we will be doing this later in the article)?

___

### El Pueblo Unido Jamás Será Vencido (Spanish song)

This is a song in a totally different language, culture and context. Yet amazingly even this song is **_in its essence_** saying the same thing.

> The united people will never be defeated,

In the very first lyric, the condition for success in any endeavour is laid bare: **_unity_**.

Now unity does not necessarily mean **unity** of a **country**. It is a much broader term, which can losely be described as **Unity in Purpose/Intention/Niyyat**. This is a much better understanding of the principle of "Unity" in my opinion: the people of a country can have different ethnicities, religions, speak different languages **but** as long as they are **united** in their _purpose_ (good or bad depends on the context), they will eventually achieve the said purpose. This might actually have something to do with the principle that "Systems tend to an equilibrium"? Have not researched this so don't know for sure.

Yet **pause** and **think**: is this not the same as what Islam says is a prerequisite for **Lailat-ul-Qadr**? Namely, unity in purpose and unity of a people based on the above definition? Is it not a principle in Islam that when there is disunity Allah's Rhamat (Mercy) is reduced and can even, _God Forbid_, be removed?

Note the _neutral_ language used here because just as each human is varied physically and mentally, so are the different Nations that these varied humans make up, hence, these terms will need to be applied carefully in different settings with due regard to the History and Culture of the different Nations on Earth.

___

> On **foot**, singing <br/>
> because we are going **triumph**. <br/>
> Advance **now**,<br/>
> flags of **unity**.<br/>
> And you will come<br/>
> marching **together** with me,<br/>
> and in that way you will see<br/>
> **your song** and your **flag flourish**.<br/>
> The **light**<br/>
> of a red **dawn**<br/>
> now announces<br/>
> the **life** which will come.

It is made clear that **change** requires hardwork (“on foot”), and we need to make a lot of noise (“singing”).
