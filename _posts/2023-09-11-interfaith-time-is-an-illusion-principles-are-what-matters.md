### Introduction

We live in a world where most religions “divines” do nothing but spread their twisted version of religion, spreading hate, divisiveness, casteism, communal disturbances and more wherever they go.

This is one of the reason I and many others use the phrase "Sellers of Hate" for these so-called religious “divines”. Some might take offence at the harshness of the language used here but I can assure you this “tough language” is more than justified. When these "Wholesalers of Hate" use their words to incite people, their are real human beings who suffer the consequences of their "speeches"/"sermons". 

Note that I have deliberately used generic language because such "Sellers of Hate" are found in **every** major religion. When running a Human Rights campaign for ***Fatima***, ***Rizwana***, ***Seema*** on X (formerly Twitter), I and any who tried to raise the voice for these young girls were made the target of their **hate**. When raising awareness about gross Human Rights violations against women and burning of Churches and Temples in Pakistan, many were again made a target of their apparatus of **hate**. When trying to spread calm using teachings from religious books when Churches were being burnt in Pakistan or India's Manipur, many attempted to counter this by directing their vitriol at us only with the aim to further spread **hate**.

All of this is shocking for any *student* of interfaith Religious Studies because we are aware of the beautiful teachings in **all** religions that these "Sellers of Hate" are twisting, misquoting and misrepresenting to further their divisive agendas.

>So what is a befitting response to these heinous acts committed by these so-called religious “divines”? Simple: we erode the very **"intellectual" foundations** of their business of **hate**.

### Problem Statement
From very *insightful* interactions online on Social Media and from observing what academics like [Dr. Ashok Swain](https://twitter.com/ashoswai) and [Dr. Moeed Pirzada](https://twitter.com/MoeedNj) do and the response they get, it seems ever more important for anyone with even **minor** amounts of knowledge in this subject to help in the **Fight for *Objective* Justice for All**.

It seems, that one of the major problems is that many people have never been exposed to other religious primary sources and what little they know of a religion is from **those sources, which vehemently oppose that religion**. So this is my effort to do something in this regard. 

>Like any good “book“ we first need a common set of glossary or terms to allow us to navigate the complex high-dimensional surface that is religion! This article will attempt to do that.

As I am a follower of an **Abrahamic** Religion (Islam), it is only natural for me to start from Abrahamic religions and work my way outwards (this is out of no disrespect to other religions but it is just easier for me to think this way.)

___

### Abrahamic Religion: Islam

There are three **Major Abrahamic** religions prevalent in the world today (sorted in ascending order based on when they were founded):
- Judaism
- Christianity
- Islam

All three of these religions have a lot of similarities, and the common origin (Abraham/Ibrahim (as)) leads to easily understandable terminology between the followers of these religions. This is not the case when followers of Abrahamic religions look at other Religious Dispositions such as Hinduism or Religions in China etc.

In Islam the Supreme Being, Prime Mover, the one in control of every particle of the Universe is called **Allah**. Now if you are like me, the first question one will have is what does **Allah** actually mean?

You will be surprised to know that **Allah** means literally **the God**! Now this seems bizarre at the start (and most of this article will until you read all of it) but there is a big reason for this.

What is the natural follow-up question that will come to our **inner child's** mind? 

>It will be something on the lines of: “Well that is not very helpful! Tell me more about Allah, the God.” 
> Almost like our inner child is excited about a new and interesting/fascinating story they have just heard.

And this seems to be exactly the aim that Allah had (at least to me) to do this. Why? Because the rest of the Quran is filled with examples from history, parables etc. explaining the different attributes of the God (Allah), allowing us to get to know Him more intimately. If you are interested in looking at the 99 names/attributes of Allah (which are quite beautiful) you can have a listen to this: [Coke Studio Special - Asma-ul-Husna - The 99 Names - Atif Aslam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgm3puP3tMA).

Allah says in the Holy Quran that he works behind a **“veil”** in the **aalme-Ghaib** (The Unseen World) and his commands (called His Words) are acted on through intermediaries called **Angels** in Abrahamic Religions and **Malaik** in Islam. Is it only me or this seems very similar to the ***Quantum World***? Its almost as if each quantum particle's state is hidden behind a **“veil”**, as we cannot be certain about a quantum particles ***state*** until we measure it (my Physics is a bit rusty so please correct me if I am wrong here, and I will happily edit this if you can make me understand why I am wrong.)?

In Islam the Holy Quran is the highest source of authority, after which the Sunnah (Actions/Way of the Holy Prophet (pbuh)) and Hadith (Sayings of the Holy Prophet (pbuh)) have authority.

So how can we summarise all of this? A diagram (CGI) will do well here. There were a few people asking why science/academia uses diagrams or CGI a lot. This is a perfect example: the diagram will summarise crucial information while casually allowing us to ignore the unimaginable complexity and detail behind these concepts!

Prophets are humans raised by Allah (the God) to guide humanity towards His teachings. The closer a Prophet is to God, the less ***"intermediaries"*** (Angels in Abrahamic Religions) are there in between this Prophet and God (Allah in Islam). 

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/islam-diagram-summary.png" alt="Simple Summary of High Level Islamic Terminology" style="width: 40em"/></p>

Some Major Prophets mentioned in Islam are Hadhrat Moses/Musa (as), Hadhrat Jesus/Isa (as), Hadhrat Joseph/Yousaf (as) and the Chief of the Prophets (Seal of the Prophets) Hadhrat Muhammad Mustafa (saw/pbuh).

___

### Abrahamic Religion: Judaism and Christianity

Judaism is another Major Abrahamic Religion. Judaism is the earliest Abrahamic religion of the three major ones. The **Torah** (Hebrew Bible/Old Testament) has a lot of similarities with the Islamic and Christian teachings and edicts. For example, **Yahweh** is the **Supreme Being** described in the Torah.

Another name of Yahweh in the Torah is **Elohim**. This is in the plural form but is used in the singular sense. This sounds very similar to **Allah** and considering the fact that Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic were evolving in the same region a link between these two names is very likely (more research in etymology will be needed to confirm this).

Being the earliest Abrahamic religion (founded by Hadhrat Ibrahim (as) in Arabic), a covenant between God (Yahweh/Elohim) and Abraham (as) and his children. There were many children on Abraham (might be wrong here so please correct me if I am) but there were two important sons:
- Isaac/Ishaq
- Ismael

Muslims consider themselves to be the Spiritual Descendants of Ismael (as) (Bani Ismael/Children of Ismael). Hadhrat Muhammad (pbuh) was also a descendant of Hadhrat Ismael (as).

The 10 commandments are very similar to the Teachings of the Holy Quran and Islam. The concepts of Prophets is again the same as the one explained above in Islam. The same concept of Angels exists in Judaism. There is also a concept of a Messiah who will come to save mankind at a very crucial and turbulent times (termed the Latter Days or End of Times (although end of times is a crude translation in my opinion)). This concept is also present in Islam.

Christianity is under the Mosaic (Musa (as)) disposition and this is one of the reason there is so much similarity between the Teachings of Hadhrat Jesus/Isa (as) and the Teachings of Holy Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). Christians believe Jesus (as) to be the Messiah prophesied in the Torah; Judaism does not and are still waiting for the Messiah to come.

However, ignoring these details there is a breathtaking amount of similarity between these three Major World Religions and countless avenues to build bridges between Jewish, Christian and Islamic communities throughout the world. All three religions have a huge focus and emphasis on charity and fighting for the Weak, poor, and destitute.

### Eastern Religions: Hinduism, Buddhism and Master Kong Zi's (孔子) "Confucianism"

I do understand that clumping the two Great and Diverse Religions of Hinduism, Buddhism and Master Kong Zi's (孔子) "Confucianism" together in one section is a **major folly**. However, I must admit my understanding of these two religions is lacking **only due to me being a follower of an Abrahamic Religion** which meant that I did not get the opportunity to look into these Great Religions **in as much detail** as I did for Abrahamic Religions. I will attempt *to **remedy** this in the near future*.

I will first attempt to give **my** brief understanding of Hinduism, however, I apologise unreservedly if I make any mistakes unknowingly.

### Hinduism

In Hinduism, the Supreme Being or Supreme Reality is called **Brahman**. Is this linked to the Brahmi script? (I have not researched *fully* into this but it seems like a possible link).

<p style="text-align: center; width: 100%"><img src="/assets/devanagri-to-brahmi-script.png" alt="Simple Summary of High Level Islamic Terminology" style="width: 30em"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 100%">(Source: <a href="https://tejesh-raut.github.io/Devanagari-to-Brahmi-script/">Devanagari(Hindi) Script to Brahmi Script Converter</a>)</p>

Interestingly, if **Lab Grown Meat** does pass safety standard (I think this is the stage it is in), there might actually be no need to ***kill*** **real animals** for the *proteins (amino acids)* in their meat! Although that is a sidetrack.

There are sub-deities (less powerful deities) in Hinduism, which could very well be a parallel for Angels in Abrahamic Religions (although I have not researched this fully so please take this with a pinch of salt).

Similarly there are manifestations of Brahman (The Supreme Being or Supreme Reality) such as Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva, and others. Note the very similar language used here as is used in **Abrahamic Religions**:
- Moses (as) is said to have been a **manifestation of Yahweh** on Earth or that Elohim (another name for Yahweh) manifested himself to Moses (as) on Mount Sinai.
- Jesus (as) is said to have been a **manifestation of God** on Earth by the Christians, and a Prophet of God by the Muslims (which seems to be just another way of saying manifestation of God).
- Holy Prophet Muhammad Mustafa (saw/pbuh) is said to have been the perfect manifestation of God on Earth, hence, he was given the title of Mercy for Mankind/Rahmat-ul-alameen.

So it seems, one would not be fully incorrect if a link between Prophets and Manifestation of Brahman (The Supreme Being or Supreme Reality) is drawn. (I apologise again if I have inadvertently caused any distress here).

There are a few sacred books in Hinduism such as the Vedas and Upanishads. There is a concept of Karma which is very similar to the Abrahamic concept of Good deeds will have good reward and bad deeds will have a bad reward, either in this life or the next.

So again there are numerous avenues to build bridges between the Great Religion of Hinduism and Abrahamic Religions.

___

### Buddhism
Buddha is said to actually have been born with the name **Siddhartha Gautama**. ***Siddhartha*** is a name from Sanskrit which means **"he who achieves his aim"**. Peculiar how similar this is to the title of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) of Sadiq (Truthful) and Ameen? This title was given to him before his Prophetic disposition began by the people of Arabia and his tribe (Quraish).

Buddha was born Lumbini to the Shakya clan so he was a Prince, in what is present day Nepal. After witnessing the severe injustices outside the Palace Walls, he rejected his privileges of Royal Life. He attained Enlightenment under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya in India. He was, hence, known after this as Buddha (i.e. given the title Buddha) which means "The Enlightened/Awakened One".

Throughout the rest of his life, The Buddha travelled and taught his Dharma (his Teachings) to help others also achieve enlightenment.

This again has a huge amount of similarities and parallels between the Abrahamic Religions and Hinduism. Just like the Muslim Ummah there is a Buddhist Sangha (i.e. community).

The Buddha's Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path will lead to the end of suffering and the ultimate aim/goal is Nirvana which seems very similar to the concept of Nafsi-Mutmainnah (the Soul at Rest or Peace).

<p style="text-align: center; width: 100%"><img src="/assets/Eight-Fold-Path-Buddhism.jpg" alt="Simple Summary of High Level Buddhist Terminology" style="width: 15em"/></p>

<p style="text-align: center; width: 100%"><img src="/assets/nafsi-mutmainnah-quran-dot-com.png" alt="" style="width: 25em"/></p>

>˹Allah will say to the righteous,˺ “O **tranquil** soul!<br/>
> Return to your Lord, well pleased ˹with Him˺ and well pleasing ˹to Him˺.<br/>
> So join **My servants**,<br/>
> and enter **My Paradise**.” <br/><br/>
> **(Surah al-Fajr 89:27-30)**

___

### Master Kong Zi's (孔子) "Confucianism"
I find it quite embarrassing that it took me so long to find out that *Confucius* was a Westernised name of **Master Kong Zi**. I was aware that Buddha had another name at birth but there is no shame in admitting that I was not even aware/nor did I figure out that "Confucius" was not the real/native name of **Master Kong Zi**.

The Analects are a collection of sayings from Master Kong Zi (similar to the Hadith of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)). After reading a verses from them, the great wisdom inside these Analects is evident to anyone who ***wants*** to understand. Master Kong Zi preached about the concepts of Li and Ren:
- Li being rituals and cultural traditions
- Ren being a deep love and focus on humanity that links all the Nations on Earth (note the deliberate usage of *Nation on Earth* not ***Human** Nations on Earth* because the teachings of these Enlightened Sages extended far beyond humanity. For example, to animals, even to inanimate objects etc. A human does not **only** need to act as a human with other humans: they can do that with animals and even inanimate (non-living) objects).

**Master Kong Zi** taught about **The Five Great Relationships**:
1. The **father** and **son** relationship
2. The **ruler** and **subject** relationship
3. The **husband** and **wife** relationship
4. The **elderly** and **younger** brother relationship
5. The **friend** and **friend** relationship

(Source: [https://studycorgi.com/confucius-the-five-great-relationships/](https://studycorgi.com/confucius-the-five-great-relationships/))

All of this is fully in line with Abrahamic Religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. So there are ***countless*** avenues to make bridges of Peace between these diverse and large communities.

<p style="text-align: center; width: 100%"><img src="/assets/major-eastern-religions-diagram-summary.png" alt="Simple Summary of High Level Islamic Terminology" style="width: 55em"/></p>

### Other Relgions: Africa, Caribbean, Native America etc.

Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the rich and diverse religious and cultural history of these Great Nations. 

>As such I do not think it is appropriate for me to talk on these Great Religions today out of respect to the respective peoples. 

I will, however, try my best to research and remedy this and write articles on these Great Religions and Cultures once I get more knowledge of these.

___

### Conclusion

This should serve as an apt response to all those **Preachers and Sellers of Hate** who want to **divide** humans along **Communal** and **Religious** lines so that the spread of **Communal Peace and Inter-Faith/No Faith harmony** is hindered. 

Can any of them now seriously claim that there is no **common link/avenues to build bridges** between these **diverse** and **Great Religions and Communities**? I don't think so (at least in a rational debate on merit! 😂)
