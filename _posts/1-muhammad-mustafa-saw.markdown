> Why is loyalty important? Is the best reward for goodness always good?

Bismillah irrahman irrahim.

In the name of Allah (The God), the most Gracious and the most Merciful. 

Assalam o alaikum. Peace be on you.

### Introduction
The recent tragic human rights violations around the world have rightly caused ripples around the World. From Churches burning in India's Manipur to Churches burning in Pakistan. From Temples burning in Jerusalam to Temples burning in African countries.

The tragic cases involving innocent children all over the world, in which even Innocent Children were not spared has rightly caused a stir around the world.

However, the question that comes to mind is why is it that a tragedy of a Child touches the hearts of most souls while other tragedies can be easily **'pigeonholed'**?

In my opinion, it is the fact that **all** humans can one way or another relate with a Child. They might have seen a child (family and friends etc). However, even if they have not, were we all not *once* children? Do we not remember fondly our tales from childhood, a **clarity** in vision, a **natural** inquisitiveness, an **undying** thirst to learn (even though at times we might *have* preferred a movie over reading a book. ðŸ˜ƒ)

Do we all not find these tales from childhood rightly inspiring? I do.

The question though is ***why***?

___

The reason, at least to me, from recent interactions on Elon Musk's X, seems to be that a Child has the three crucial qualities listed above:
1. Clarity in **vision**.
2. Genuine **inquisitiveness** (being amazed by what might seem simple *or* mundane to us *'more mature'* adults).
3. Undying thirst for **knowledge**.

It's almost as if there are no *'veils'* between a child and their *soul* / *purpose* in life.

This might seem confusing at first but that is the whole point: a child **knows** what **they** truly value. This is evident from **ironically** one of their qualities that most people *complain* about: children leave things very quickly, cannot 'focus' on things etc.

Why is this the case? (It is often when comparing/contrasting two concepts that one gets the '*gist*/essence' of a concept. Think about it: why do we feel a car or horse accelerating/decelerating initially **but not** when driving on 120 km/h for a while on a *straight* road?)

In fact, **this whole** article up to this point has been an *exercise* in this whole concept. [1]

Could it be that this **juxtaposition** i.e. comparing and contrasting is what leads to *true* insights?

Isn't it peculiar that Enlightened Sages and Holy Books from the past, wise people, a good investor all *mostly* talk in **parables**, not in black and white? Isn't the Quran covered with countless commands to "pause and think"?

However, when it comes to their **real fundamental** ideals they are uncompromisingly loyal.

Allama Iqbal (Poet of the East) summarises this idea beautifully in his **Bal-e-Jibril: 139 | Aik Naujawan Ke Naam | To A Young Man** [3]

Equally, isn't this explained beautifully by the song Khalasi from Coke Studio Baharat (India)? [4]

I mean the very reason you are still reading this article *probably* is because it is different from the majority of the articles out there.

There are so many parables for this: "Where everyone thinks the same, no one thinks a lot" etc. No investment advisor, *ideally*, would ever just tell you to "invest and don't think".

Isn't it peculiar most of the Enlightened Sages from the past faced immense adversity? The Holy Prophet Muhammad Mustafa (saw) was an Orphan after all. How many movies will we need to *see* to finally understand the plight of an Orphan (trick question)?

This is tragically evident from the saying of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (saw) in his hadith (find reference):
(on the lines of): "If only I could here the call of my mother I would stop my namaz."

___

Reading intricate detailed imaginative language about **day** and **night** in a book for years will still *not* give the same experience as seeing **day** and **night**.

Could this actually be linked to what we call **entropy**, the "most misunderstood concept in Physics" as beautifully explained by
Veritasium? [2]
