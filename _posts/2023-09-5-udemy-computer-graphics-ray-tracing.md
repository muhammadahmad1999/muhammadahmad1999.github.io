> Build a Toy Ray Tracer (Graphics) from Scratch



I created another course on Udemy to teach about a topic that fascinates me (and many others): how can a simple ray of light lead to the beautiful image of the world that we see through our eyes?

The course ([Link with referral code](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-ray-tracer-from-scratch/learn/lecture/28314894?referralCode=B00A657610D4EBAB0D28)) gives an introduction to Ray Tracing which attempts to "simulate" light in the real world (vaguely speaking), giving us some intuition about light in the real world.

The course is short (about 1 hour of video content), however, by the end it can produce the Ray Traced images attached to this post.

I hope this introductory course increases interest in Ray Tracing and inspires others to learn more about this fascinating topic.


### Course Description
We will be implementing a simple toy ray tracer in this course.



Ray tracing is a very important 3D graphics rendering technique. We normally emulate how light works: we emulate the fresnel effect, emulate bounce lighting, emulate global illumination, and so on.



With ray tracing we "simulate" light: we follow light how it actually operates in the real world (but with a twist). As such we get a lot of effects for free:

- Colour Bleed

- Bloom

- Ambient Occlusion

- Realistic Shadows

- Shadow Fallout

- Diffuse Materials



All of these would take a lot of code to emulate but as you will see in this course, these can be implemented very easily using ray tracing.



In this course we will be doing the following:



1) Implement a triangle primitive (you can use this to render OBJ meshes as a challenge)

2) Implement sphere primitive

3) Implement area lights

4) Implement direct lighting for diffuse materials

5) Implement indirect lighting for diffuse materials

6) Render a variation of the famous Cornell Box scene



If you love making things from scratch, you will love this course. In a little over an hour, you will make your own ray tracer from scratch. This course is oriented towards beginners and so should be easily picked up by anybody.

What youâ€™ll learn:
- Ray Tracing
- Realistic Graphics
- Graphics
- 
Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?
- C++

Who this course is for:
- Beginner to Intermediate developers who have working knowledge of C++ interested in Computer Graphics
